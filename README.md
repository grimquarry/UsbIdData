This is a stand-alone class that can be used in C++ programs that need to list all currently plugged
in usb devices.  In addition to this it will find the usb.ids file on Debian based systems and allows to 
search vendor names using the vendor hexidecimal ID.  Clone this repo to grab the UsbIdData.h and UsbIdData.cpp
files and add the to your own projects.  A test driver program is included in this repo as an example and to 
test functionality.  Clone this repo to the directory of your choice and from that directory run "make" on the command
line.  This will compile the test driver, which you can then run by typing ./run on the command line.
